\subsection{2Q synthesis cost modeling}\label{sec:2q_synthesis_cost_modeling}



\subsection{Routing in canonical form}\label{sec:routing_in_canonical_form}






- Unified and highly-effective qubit routing approach in canonical form, with properties of quantum ISAs tailored to the routing process


\subsection{Enhanced optimization via commutation}\label{sec:gate_commutation_guided_optimization}

- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by gate commutation; while commutation relations can be uniformly described in canonical form



\begin{theorem}[Canonical gate commutation]\label{thm:commutation}
    Let $\,\Can(a,b,c)_{q_0,q_1}$ and $\,\Can(a',b',c')_{q_1,q_2}$ be two canonical gates acting on qubits ($q_0, q_1$) and ($q_1, q_2$) respectively, with an overlapping qubit $ q_1 $. They are commutative \dquote{if and only if}
    \begin{align}
        b=b'=c=c'=0,
    \end{align}
    that is, when both consist solely of $\,\XX$ rotations.
\end{theorem}
