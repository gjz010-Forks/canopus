\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}




Two-fold motivations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The scalable qubit routing effects (2x-4x) is still a critical challenge in practical quantum computing systems
    \item How to utilize the emerging advanced ISAs (hardware breakthroughs); across all phases of compilation, routing is the bottleneck and is the most easily handled for co-optimization
\end{enumerate}


\ZY{Use a \dquote{optimal routing benchmark} to illustrate the OVERHEAD of existing methods}


\ZY{There should be many takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Previous routing overhead is not precise for hardware execution
    \item Previous routing is costly and also not precise for hardware execution
    \item SWAP can be implemented in low overhead (gate duration) with the recent breakthrough gate schemes for advanced ISAs 
    \item How to efficiently capture the rich commutation relations when performing co-optimization during qubit routing and gate scheduling
\end{itemize}

- gate duration
- depth driven
