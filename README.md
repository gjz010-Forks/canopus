# 🧭 Canopus: Canonical-Optimized Placement Utility Suite

**Canopus** (**Can**onical-**O**ptimized **P**lacement **U**tility **S**uite) is a qubit mapping/routing framework tailored to advanced quantum ISAs. Its main function is to optimize the layout and routing of qubits on quantum hardware, uniformly handling optimal synthesis with diverse ISAs, gate commutation relations, and qubit dependencies through two-qubit canonical gate representation, providing guidance for hardware-software co-design.





Contributions：
- Unified and highly-effective qubit routing approach in canonical form, with properties of quantum ISAs tailored to the routing process
- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by gate commutation; while commutation relations can be uniformly described in canonical form
- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by qubit dependencies, which implies optimization in a more global scope
- Comprehensive analysis and evaluation with the underlying routing framework, for diverse quantum ISAs and hardware architectures, providing guidance for hardware-software co-design in real-world quantum program execution
